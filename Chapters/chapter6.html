    <p><span id="color">Key Concept:</span> Gamets have half the number of chromosomes that body cells have.</p>
    <p><span id="color">Section Summary:</span> Gamets have half the number of chromosomes that body cells have. Your body has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, making 46 total chromosomes. Gametes have only one chromosome from each homologous pair - 23 chromosomes in all.</p>
    <p><span id="color">Main Ideas:</span><br><span><a id="test2"href="#S1">You have cells and gametes</a></span> <br> <span><a href="#S2">Your cells have autosomes and sex chromosomes</a></span> <br><span><a href="#S3">Body cells are diploid; gametes are haploid</a></span></p>
    <p><span id="color">Vocabulary:</span> <br> <span id="blue">Somatic Cells: </span>Cells that make up the body tissues and organs, except for gametes. <br> <span id="blue">Gamete:</span> A haploid reproductive cell the unites with another reproductive cell to form a zygote. <br> <span id="blue">Homologous Chromosome:</span> Chromosomes that have the same length, appearance, and copies of genes, although the alleles may differ. <br> <span id="blue">Autosome:</span> Any chromosome that is not a sex chromosome. <br> <span id="blue">Sex Chromosome:</span> One of the pair of chromosomes that determine the sex of an individual.

    <p><span id="color">Connect to your World:</span> Prehaps your are familiar with "Everything old is new again" the phrase usually indicates that a past style is again current. However, it applies equally well to you. The fusion of a single egg and sperm cell resulted in the complex creature that is you. There's never been anyone quite like you. And yet the DNA that directs your cells came from your mother and father. In this chapter, you will examine the process that went into makin you who you are.</p>

   <p id="S1"><span id="color">Main Idea:</span><span id="blue"> You have body cells and gametes</span><br><span id="indent">You have many types of specialized cells in your body, but they can be divided into two major groups: somatic cells and germ cells.</span> Somatic cells, also called body cells, make up most of your body tissues and organs. For example, your spleen, kidneys, and eyeballs are all made entirely of body cells. DNA in your body cells is nor passed to your children. Germ cells, in contrast, are cells in your reproductive organs, the ovaries, or the testes, that develop into gametes. Gametes are sex cells-ova or eggs in the female, and spermatoza, or sperm cells, in the male. DNA in your gametes can be passed on to your children. <br> <span id="indent">Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes per cell.</span> This number is typically given for body cells, not gametes. Chromosome number does not seem to be related to the complexity of an organism. For example, yeast have 32 chromosomes, which come in 16 pairs. The fruit flies, commonly used in genetic experiments, have 8 chromosomes, which come in 4 pairs. A fern holds the record for most chromosomes-more than 1200. Each of your body cells contains a set of 46 chromosomes, which comes in 23 pairs. These cells are genetically identical to each other unless mutations have occurred. As you have learned, cells within an organism differ from one another because different genes are expressed, not because they have different genes.</p> 
   
   <p id="S2"><span id="color">Main Idea:</span><span id="blue"> Your cells have autosomes and sex chromosomes</span><br><span id="indent">Suppose you had 23 pairs of gloves.</span>you would have a total of 46 gloves that you could divide into two sets, 23 right and 23 left. Similarly, your body cells 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 that can be divided into two sets: 23 from your mother and 23 from your father. Just as you use both gloves when its cold outside, your cells use both sets of chromosomes to function properly. <br><span id="indent"> Together, each pair of chromosomes is reffered to as a homologous pair.</span> In this coontext, the word homologous means "having the same structure." Homologous chromosomes are two chromosomes0one inherited from the mother, and one inherited from the father-that have the same length and general appearance. More importantly, these chromosomes have copies of the same genes, although the two copies may differ. For example. if you have a gene that influences blood cholesterol levels on chromosome 8, you will have one copy from your mother and one copy from your father. It is possible that one of these copies is associated with high cholesterol levels while the other is associated with low cholesterol levels. For convenience, scientists have assigned a number to each pair of homologous chromosomes ordered from largest to smallest. <br> <span id="indent">Collectivly, </span>chromosome pairs 1 through 22 make up your autosomes, which are chromosomes that contain genes for characteristics not directly related to the sex of an organism, but what about the 23rd chromosome pair? <br><span id="indent">Most </span>sexually reproducing species have sex chromosomes that directly control the development of sexual characteristic. Humans have two very different sex chromosome, X and Y. How sex is determined varies by species. In all mammals, including humans, an organism's sex is determined by the XY system. An organism with two X chromosomes is female, an organism with one X and one Y chromosome is male. Sex chromosomes make up your 23rd pair of chromosomes. Although the X and Y chromosomes pair with each other, they are not homologous. The X chromosome is the larger sex chromosome and contains numerous genes, including many that are unrelated to sexual characteristics. The Y chromosome is the sex chromosome that contains genes that direct the development of the testes and other male traits. It is the smallest chromosome and carries the fewest genes.</p>
   
   <p id="S3"><span id="color">Main Idea:</span><span id="blue"> Body cells are diploid; gametes are haploid</span><br><span id="indent">Sexual</span> reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes, resulting in offspring that are a genetic mixture of both parents. The actual fusion of an egg and sprem cell is called fertilization. When fertilization occurs, the nuclei of the egg and sperm cell fuse to form one nucleus. The new nucleus must have the correct number of chromosomes for a healthy new organism to develop. Therefore, both the egg and the sperm cell need only half the usual number of chromosomes-one chromosome from each homologous pair. <br> <span id="blue">Diploid and Haploid Cells</span><br> <span id="indent">Body</span> cells and gametes have different numbers of chromosomes. Your body cells are diploid. Diploid means that a cell has two copies of each chromosome: one copy from the mother, and one copy from the father. Diploid cells can be represented as 2n. In humans, the diploid chromosome number is 46. <br><span id="indent">Gametes</span> are not diploid cells; they are haploid cells represented as <em>n</em>. Haploid means that a cell has only one copy of each chromosome. Each human egg or sperm cell has 22 autosomes and 1 sex chromosome. In the egg, the sex chromosome is always an X chromosome. In the sperm cell, the sex chromosome can be an X or a Y chromosome. The reason for this difference will be discussed in the sections to follow. <br> <span id="indent">Maintaining</span> the correct number of chromosomes is important to the survival of all organisms. Typically, a change in the number of chromosomes an organism has is harmful. However, increasing the number of sets of chromosomes can, on occasion, give rise to a new species. The fertilization of nanohaploid gametes has played an important role in plant evolution by rapidly making new species with more than two sets of chromosomes. For example, some plants have four copies of each chromosome, a condition called tetraploidy (<em>4n</em>). This type of event has occured in many groups of plants, but it is very rare in animals. <br><span id="blue">Meiosis</span><br><span id="indent">Germ </span>cells in our reproductive organs undergo the process of meiosis to form gametes. Meiosis is a form of nuclear division that divides a diploid cell into haploid cells. This process is essential for sexual reproduction. The details of meiosis will be presneted in the next section. <br><span id="indent">You</span> have already learned about mitosis, another form of nuclear division. Recall that mitosis is a process that occurs in body cells. It helps produce daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In cells undergoing mitosis, DNA is copied once and divided once. Both the parent cell and the daughter cell are diploid. Mitosis is used for development, growth, and repair in all types of organisms. It is also used for reproduction in asexually reproducing eukaryotes. <br><span id="indent">In contrast,</span> meiosis occurs in germ cells to produce gametes. This process is sometimes called a "reproduction division" because it reduces a cells chromosome number by half. In cells undergoing mitosis, DNA is copied once but divided twice. Meiosis makes genetically unique haploid cells from a diploid cell. These haploid cells than undergo more processing in the ovaries or testes, finally forming mature gametes.</p>
