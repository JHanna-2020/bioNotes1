    <p><span id="color">Key Concept:</span> Gamets have half the number of chromosomes that body cells have.</p>
    <p><span id="color">Section Summary:</span> Gamets have half the number of chromosomes that body cells have. Your body has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, making 46 total chromosomes. Gametes have only one chromosome from each homologous pair - 23 chromosomes in all.</p>
    <p><span id="color">Main Idea:</span><br>You have cells and gametes <br> Your cells have autosomes and sex chromosomes <br> Body cells are diploid; gametes are haploid</p>
    <p><span id="color">Vocabulary:</span> <br> <span id="blue">Somatic Cells: </span>Cells that make up the body tissues and organs, except for gametes. <br> <span id="blue">Gamete:</span> A haploid reproductive cell the unites with another reproductive cell to form a zygote. <br> <span id="blue">Homologous Chromosome:</span> Chromosomes that have the same length, appearance, and copies of genes, although the alleles may differ. <br> <span id="blue">Autosome:</span> Any chromosome that is not a sex chromosome. <br> <span id="blue">Sex Chromosome:</span> One of the pair of chromosomes that determine the sex of an individual.
    <br> <span id="blue">Sexual Reproduction:</span> Reproduction in which gametes from two parents unite. <br><span id="blue">Fertilization:</span> The union of a male and female gamete to form a zygote. <br> <span id="blue">Diploid:</span> A cell that contains two haploid sets of chromosomes. <br> <span id="blue">Haploid:</span> Describes a cell, nucleus, or organism that has only one set of unpaired chromosomes. <br> <span id="blue">Meiosis:</span> A process in cell division during which the number of chromosomes decreases to half the original number by two divisions of the nucleus, which results in the reproduction of sex cells (gametes ore spores).</p>
    
    <p><span id="color">TEKS:</span><br><span id="blue">6A:</span> Identifiy components of DNA, and describe how information for specifying the traits of an organism is carried in the DNA. <br> <span id="blue">6G:</span> Recognize the significance of meiosis to sexual reproduction.</p>

    <p><span id="color">Connect to your World:</span> Prehaps your are familiar with "Everything old is new again" the phrase usually indicates that a past style is again current. However, it applies equally well to you. The fusion of a single egg and sperm cell resulted in the complex creature that is you. There's never been anyone quite like you. And yet the DNA that directs your cells came from your mother and father. In this chapter, you will examine the process that went into makin you who you are.</p>

   <p>Main Idea:<span id="blue">You have body cells and gametes</span><br>You have many types of specialized cells in your body, but they can be divided into two major groups: somatic cells and gamatic cells</p>
